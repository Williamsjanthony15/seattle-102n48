## Bio
My Name is Anthony Williams, I am a 25 year old, Self Taught Man that learned really early in life that nothing is free, the world doesnt care about you any more than you care about it, you're not entitled to anything, and nothing is easy. My mother passed away from Metastatic Melanoma when i was 11 years old. I moved with my father, That I didnt know. My parents were divorced before my brain could make a cognative memory. I grew up with a mom, a sister, a half sister that was a druggie, and a half brother that was a druggie, career criminal. I watched many bad examples of how to run your life and i decided rather than follow in those footsteps, to plow my own path in life and show how a "expected failure" can succeed. I moved with my father across the country with his new wife. They kicked my sister and I out to my uncles house. I was in highschool when I met my wife. My uncled ended up kicking me out and i had to live with my wife (girlfriend) at the time and her parents. I decided the Army was the place to be. I got on my feet and took the world by the reigns and rode the whip. Here i am 8 years later. I had a sucessfull career in the Army, Deployed and served my country, I am already the longest married male in my family, a father to two Punks boys (not really), 4 y/o and 9 m/o, Own my own home at 25, own 2 cars, 0 debt, and not a shame to my name. Take that Destiny. Take that and turn back around. I write my own story.

"You are the auther of your own story." 
"A man came up to a GURU, and said "Teach me to make more money, Teach me to be successfull in life." the guru said "Alright, meet me at the beach at 6am." The man thought "what the beach? I said i want to make money, be sucessfull not learn how to swim?"... The man gets to the beach at 6am and guru says "go out there to the end of the dock." The man said " man im out of here, im done." the Guru said you want to make money, be sucessfull you walk out there to the end of the dock." The man walked out there and as soon as he got there the guru pushed him under the water and held him there just shy of long enough for him drown and he brought him back up and he said "now while you were down there, what did you want to do the most?" He said **"BREATH"** and he said "If you want to **SUCCEED**, as bad as you want to **BREATH**.... **THAN** you will be **successfull**" 

Your mindset should never ending. If you think you are the smartest person in the room, than your in the wrong room. There will always be somebody smarter, faster and better than you at any given task. Heres the deal, dont let the knowledge of somebody being better than you, stop you from being better than them. Growing in whatever thing you are doing is a should be a non stop, constant grind. Incasing all information you know, you want to know, and you need to know. Make your lifelong dream and than drive your life for 5 steps past that. Notice when competition runners go 150% until after they have passed the finish line? 

1. In the Army the Flag on my right shoulder is backwards due to always moving forward. I have found it in my own personal life that, that meaning has really brought a different aspect into my life. I take that as i should never retreat. Nothing is to big or complicated to learn and deal with.

2. When you're a baby, you automatically know how to do SOME things. Those things are to breath, blink, and move. The things you aren't born with are the things you have to LEARN. You learn by watching others, failing, picking yourself back up and try again. You have to walk before you can run... 

3. Failure is the BEST way to learn something.
